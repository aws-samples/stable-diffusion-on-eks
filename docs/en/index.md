# Stable Diffusion on EKS

Implement a scalable and cost-effective Stable Diffusion image generation solution using serverless and container solutions on AWS

Stable Diffusion is a popular open-source project that generates images using generative AI technology. Building a scalable and cost-effective inference solution is a common challenge faced by AWS customers. This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable asynchronous image generation architecture using serverless and container services.

## Key Features

- Event-driven architecture
- Autoscaling based on queue length using KEDA
- Automatic EC2 instance provisioning using Karpenter
- Scale new inference nodes within 2 minutes
- Save up to 70% cost using GPU Spot instances
- Support for various community Stable Diffusion runtimes
